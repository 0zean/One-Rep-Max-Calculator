# One Rep Max Calculator
 A simple python program to calculate your one rep max estimate using PyQt5 to make the application.

 3 common formulas for an athlete's one-repetition max (Epley, Bryzcki, & Mayhew) are calculated using weight lifted and number of repetitions performed as user inputs, then averaged together to the nearest 5 lbs. to give an estimate of the maximum weight, in pounds, an individual can lift for one repetition. 

 An executable file for the application is included and can be compiled on your own from the main.py, Ui_Calc.py, and calc.ui files using pyinstaller.


**Requirments**
- PyQt5
- pyinstaller (if you wish to compile an exe yourself)
